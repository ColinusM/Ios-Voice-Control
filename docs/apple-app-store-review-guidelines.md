# Apple App Store Review Guidelines (2025)

**Source:** https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/  
**Last Updated:** May 2025  
**Status:** Living Document

## Overview

The App Store Review Guidelines provide guidance and examples across a range of development topics, including user interface design, functionality, content, and the use of specific technologies. These guidelines are intended to help you prepare your app for the App Review process and speed your app through review when you submit it.

**Key Principle:** When people install an app from the App Store, they want to feel confident that it's safe to do soâ€”that the app doesn't contain upsetting or offensive content, won't damage their device, and isn't likely to cause physical harm from its use.

## Recent Updates (May 2025)

### United States Court Decision Compliance
The App Review Guidelines were updated on May 1, 2025, for compliance with a United States court decision regarding buttons, external links, and other calls to action in apps. These changes affect apps distributed on the United States storefront of the App Store.

**Key Changes:**
- Apps on the United States storefront are not prohibited from including buttons, external links, or other calls to action when allowing users to browse NFT collections owned by others
- No entitlement is required for NFT browsing functionality
- The prohibition on encouraging users to use a purchasing method other than in-app purchase does not apply on the United States storefront
- The External Link Account entitlement is not required for US storefront apps
