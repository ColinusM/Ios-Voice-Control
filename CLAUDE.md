4. **For code navigation** ‚Üí Use mcp_serena for semantic analysis
5. **For current info** ‚Üí Use mcp_brave_search for latest practices

### ü§ñ Technology Agents

**Available specialized agents in `claude_md_files/` folder:**

- **Swift/iOS**: `CLAUDE-SWIFT-IOS-AGENT.md` - Scope error prevention, framework imports, type safety
- **React**: `CLAUDE-REACT.md` - Component patterns, type safety, testing  
- **Node.js**: `CLAUDE-NODE.md` - Server patterns, async/await, error handling
- **Java Gradle**: `CLAUDE-JAVA-GRADLE.md` - Build system patterns
- **Python**: `CLAUDE-PYTHON-BASIC.md` - Python development patterns

**To activate an agent, simply tell Claude:**
- "use Swift iOS agent"
- "use React agent" 
- "use Node agent"

**That's it.** No automatic detection - you control when to apply specific technology best practices.

## üî• MANDATORY: Use iPhone 16 iOS 18.5 Simulator Only

**CRITICAL RULE: ALWAYS use iPhone 16 iOS 18.5 simulator for builds and testing. NEVER use physical device or other simulators.**

For this iOS project, use the optimized simulator workflow:

```bash
# REQUIRED: Build for iPhone 16 iOS 18.5 simulator
cd /Users/colinmignot/Cursor/Ios\ Voice\ Control/PRPs-agentic-eng && xcodebuild -project VoiceControlApp.xcodeproj -scheme VoiceControlApp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 18.5,OS=18.5' -configuration Debug build

# Then launch the app on simulator (after successful build)
xcrun simctl launch 5B1989A0-1EC8-4187-8A99-466B20CB58F2 com.voicecontrol.app
```

**Why iPhone 16 iOS 18.5 Simulator Only:**
- Consistent testing environment
- No iOS 26 compatibility issues (FBSceneErrorDomain crashes)
- Firebase Authentication works properly
- Google Sign-In bypassed in simulator (as intended)
- Biometric authentication properly protected for simulator
- Auto-login testing functionality works
- Fast rebuild and deployment cycles

This command:
- Builds the iOS app for simulator target
- Builds for iPhone 16 iOS 18.5 simulator (5B1989A0-1EC8-4187-8A99-466B20CB58F2)
- Creates build artifacts for simulator
- Ready to launch with xcrun simctl command
- Uses proper xcodebuild for simulator target

### ‚ùå DO NOT USE THESE COMMANDS:
```bash
# NEVER USE PHYSICAL DEVICE:
ios-deploy -b .../Debug-iphoneos/VoiceControlApp.app -i 2b51e8a8e9ffe69c13296dd6673c5e0d47027e14  # ‚ùå WRONG

# NEVER USE OTHER SIMULATORS:
ios-deploy -b .../Debug-iphonesimulator/VoiceControlApp.app -i [OTHER_SIMULATOR_ID]  # ‚ùå WRONG
```

## iOS Simulator Log Capture Workflow

After deploying with the fast build command, capture simulator logs for debugging:

**Simulator Log Capture:**

When you say "grab logs", Claude retrieves recent logs from iOS simulator buffer - captures your past testing activity without needing live capture during testing.

```bash
# SIMULATOR LOGS ONLY (5s max) - Recent buffer, no live streaming
tail -200 /Users/colinmignot/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/5B1989A0-1EC8-4187-8A99-466B20CB58F2/data/Library/Logs/system.log | grep VoiceControlApp | head -30

# OAUTH/GOOGLE ERRORS - Past authentication issues  
tail -300 /Users/colinmignot/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/5B1989A0-1EC8-4187-8A99-466B20CB58F2/data/Library/Logs/system.log | grep -E "(Google|OAuth|blocked)" | head -20

# APP CRASHES - Past error buffer
tail -100 /Users/colinmignot/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/5B1989A0-1EC8-4187-8A99-466B20CB58F2/data/Library/Logs/system.log | grep -E "(VoiceControlApp.*error|crash)" | head -15
```

**CRITICAL: All log commands must complete within 5 seconds and only read past buffer logs - never live stream.**

**Buffer-Based Log Workflow:**
1. **Build & Deploy**: Claude launches app to iPhone 16 iOS 18.5 simulator
2. **Manual Testing**: You test freely - no logging interference 
3. **Request Logs**: Say "grab logs" to get recent buffer:
   - "grab logs" ‚Üí MINIMAL (50 lines, app-only)
   - "grab verbose logs" ‚Üí VERBOSE (200 lines, includes UIKit)
   - "grab error logs" ‚Üí ERROR HUNTING (crashes only)
4. **Analysis**: Claude analyzes your past testing activity from iOS simulator buffer
5. **Iterate**: Build ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Grab ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Repeat

## üõë MANDATORY: File Addition to Xcode Project Rule

**CRITICAL: Every time you create a new Swift file, you MUST add it to the Xcode project before building.**

**‚úÖ WORKING Command for adding new files to build target:**
```bash
cd "/Users/colinmignot/Cursor/Ios Voice Control/PRPs-agentic-eng" && python3 -c "
import pbxproj
project = pbxproj.XcodeProject.load('VoiceControlApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj')
project.add_file('VoiceControlApp/Path/To/NewFile.swift', target_name='VoiceControlApp')
project.save()
print('‚úÖ NewFile.swift added to VoiceControlApp target')
"
```

**Alternative method (if Python method fails):**
```bash
cd "/Users/colinmignot/Cursor/Ios Voice Control/PRPs-agentic-eng" && pbxproj file VoiceControlApp.xcodeproj VoiceControlApp/Path/To/NewFile.swift
```

**Examples of recent successful file additions:**
```bash
# EffectsProcessor.swift
cd "/Users/colinmignot/Cursor/Ios Voice Control/PRPs-agentic-eng" && python3 -c "
import pbxproj
project = pbxproj.XcodeProject.load('VoiceControlApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj')
project.add_file('VoiceControlApp/VoiceCommand/Services/EffectsProcessor.swift', target_name='VoiceControlApp')
project.save()
print('‚úÖ EffectsProcessor.swift added to VoiceControlApp target')
"
```

**This applies to ALL new Swift files:**
- Service classes (ChannelProcessor, RoutingProcessor, EffectsProcessor, etc.)
- UI components
- Model files
- Extension files
- Test files

**NEVER attempt to build without adding new files to the project first.**

## üõë MANDATORY: Universal Manual Action Stop Rule

**META RULE: When you discover that ANY task requires manual actions that Claude Code terminal cannot perform agentically, you MUST:**

1. **Stop implementation immediately** - Do not continue coding or create workarounds
2. **Clearly identify what manual action is needed** - Be specific about what the user must do
3. **Explain why Claude Code cannot complete this step agentically** - Cannot access GUI, web interfaces, IDE settings, etc.
4. **Provide exact instructions for the user** - Step-by-step guidance
5. **Wait for user confirmation** - Do not proceed until the user has completed the manual steps

### Pattern:
```
üõë MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED

**[Task] cannot be completed without [specific manual action].**

What you need to do:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2] 
3. [Step 3]

After completing these steps, I can help you:
- [Next automated steps]
```

**This rule applies to ANY manual action, including but not limited to:**
- Xcode project settings (URL schemes, capabilities, build settings)
- Package dependencies requiring GUI installation
- IDE-specific configurations
- External service configurations (Google Cloud, Firebase, etc.)
- System dependencies requiring admin access
- Development certificates or signing
- Database schemas requiring DBA approval
- Any GUI-based configuration that terminal tools cannot access

## Development Workflow

**Standard Development Cycle:**
1. **Make changes** to Swift files in Xcode
2. **Build and deploy** using xcodebuild command to iPhone 16 iOS 18.5 simulator
3. **Test manually** on iPhone 16 iOS 18.5 simulator (required)
4. **Capture logs** when needed using buffer-based commands (5s max)
5. **Iterate** quickly with hot reloading enabled

**Architecture Guidelines:**
- **MVVM Pattern**: Separate Views, ViewModels, and Services
- **Dependency Injection**: Services injected into ViewModels
- **State Management**: @Published properties with ObservableObject
- **Error Handling**: Result types with custom error models
- **Security**: Never log sensitive data (tokens, passwords)

**Code Organization:**
- **Modular Structure**: Feature-based folders (Authentication/, SpeechRecognition/)
- **Service Layer**: External API integrations (Google, Firebase, AssemblyAI)
- **Shared Components**: Reusable UI and utility components
- **Model Separation**: Clear data model definitions

**Testing Approach:**
- **Manual Testing**: Primary method on iPhone 16 iOS 18.5 simulator
- **Authentication Flow**: Test Google sign-in (bypassed in simulator), logout, session persistence
- **Speech Features**: Test microphone permissions and real-time transcription
- **Network Scenarios**: Test various connectivity conditions
- **Biometric Auth**: Test Face ID/Touch ID simulation
- **Hot Reload**: Verify UI changes reflect immediately during development

**Testing Workflow:**
1. Build & deploy with xcodebuild command
2. Manual testing on iPhone 16 iOS 18.5 simulator
3. Capture logs when needed (buffer-based, 5s max)
4. Iterate with hot reloading for UI changes

## Development Best Practices

**‚úÖ DO:**
- Use iPhone 16 iOS 18.5 simulator (stable, consistent)
- Follow MVVM architecture with clear separation
- Use SwiftUI best practices and existing patterns
- Implement proper error handling with Result types
- Use dependency injection for services
- Follow existing code style and naming conventions
- Use hot reloading for rapid UI development
- Capture logs efficiently (buffer-based, 5s max)

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Use physical device or other simulators (compatibility issues)
- Hardcode credentials or sensitive data
- Skip URL scheme configuration (breaks OAuth)
- Create workarounds for manual setup requirements
- Continue when manual actions are needed
- Block main thread with heavy operations
- Log sensitive authentication data
- Use live streaming for log capture

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New Authentication Method
1. Create service in `Authentication/Services/`
2. Extend `AuthenticationState.swift` and error models
3. Update `AuthenticationManager.swift`
4. Add UI components in `Authentication/Views/`
5. Test with iPhone 16 iOS 18.5 simulator

### Adding New Speech Feature
1. Extend models in `SpeechRecognition/Models/`
2. Modify `AssemblyAIStreamer.swift`
3. Update `StreamingConfig.swift`
4. Test real-time functionality

### Debugging Common Issues
1. **Build Failures**: Clean Xcode build folder (‚åò‚áßK), verify simulator
2. **Authentication Issues**: Check URL schemes in Info.plist, verify Firebase config
3. **Speech Recognition**: Verify microphone permissions, check AssemblyAI API key
4. **WebSocket Errors**: Check network connectivity, verify endpoint URLs

### Log Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Standard app logs (use this most often)
tail -200 /Users/colinmignot/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/5B1989A0-1EC8-4187-8A99-466B20CB58F2/data/Library/Logs/system.log | grep VoiceControlApp | head -30

# OAuth/authentication errors
tail -300 /Users/colinmignot/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/5B1989A0-1EC8-4187-8A99-466B20CB58F2/data/Library/Logs/system.log | grep -E "(Google|OAuth|blocked)" | head -20

# App crashes and errors
tail -100 /Users/colinmignot/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/5B1989A0-1EC8-4187-8A99-466B20CB58F2/data/Library/Logs/system.log | grep -E "(VoiceControlApp.*error|crash)" | head -15
```

```

## üéØ MANDATORY: Proactive Direct URL Rule

**When giving manual web navigation instructions (because Claude Code cannot access GUIs), ALWAYS proactively provide direct URLs first.**

**Auto-detect scenarios requiring manual web action and immediately provide direct URLs:**

- OAuth/Cloud console configuration ‚Üí Provide direct console URLs
- IDE settings that require GUI ‚Üí Provide direct documentation/settings URLs  
- External service setup ‚Üí Provide direct service URLs
- Account/billing configuration ‚Üí Provide direct account URLs

**Examples:**
- "You need to add test users in OAuth consent screen" ‚Üí Immediately provide: `https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=project-1020288809254`
- "Configure Firebase authentication" ‚Üí Immediately provide: `https://console.firebase.google.com/project/PROJECT_ID/authentication`
- "Set up Apple Developer certificates" ‚Üí Immediately provide: `https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list`

**Pattern: Direct URL first, then step-by-step instructions.**

**Initiative rule: Don't wait for user to ask for URLs - proactively provide them when giving any manual web navigation instructions.**

Remember: When external service configuration is needed (Google Cloud, Firebase, etc.), **STOP** and request manual user action rather than creating workarounds.

### Analysis Summary

# Network Settings View Component Analysis

The **Network Settings View** component is a crucial part of the application, providing a user interface for configuring and managing network-related settings, primarily for sending RCP (Remote Control Protocol) commands to external devices like Yamaha consoles or a Mac GUI for testing.

## High-Level Architecture

The application's network configuration is managed through a dedicated SwiftUI view, **NetworkSettingsView** [NetworkSettingsView.swift](PRPs-agentic-eng/VoiceControlApp/NetworkSettingsView.swift), which acts as the primary interface for users to adjust network parameters. This view relies on a shared **NetworkSettings** [NetworkSettings.swift](PRPs-agentic-eng/VoiceControlApp/NetworkSettings.swift) object for persistent storage and state management of network configurations, and a **RCPNetworkClient** [RCPNetworkClient.swift](PRPs-agentic-eng/VoiceControlApp/RCPNetworkClient.swift) for performing actual network operations like connection testing.

## NetworkSettingsView Component

The **NetworkSettingsView** [NetworkSettingsView.swift](PRPs-agentic-eng/VoiceControlApp/NetworkSettingsView.swift) is a SwiftUI `View` responsible for presenting and allowing users to modify network-related settings within the application.

### Purpose

Its primary responsibility is to provide a user-friendly interface for:
*   Selecting the target for RCP commands (e.g., Yamaha Console, Mac GUI).
*   Configuring IP addresses and ports for selected targets.
*   Testing network connections to configured targets.
*   Displaying connection status and network availability.
*   Adjusting advanced settings like connection timeouts and logging.
*   Resetting settings to default values.

### Internal Parts

The **NetworkSettingsView** [NetworkSettingsView.swift](PRPs-agentic-eng/VoiceControlApp/NetworkSettingsView.swift) is structured using SwiftUI's `Form` and `Section` components, organizing settings into logical groups:

*   **Properties:**
    *   `@StateObject private var networkSettings = NetworkSettings.shared`: Manages the persistent network settings and their state.
    *   `@StateObject private var networkClient = RCPNetworkClient.shared`: Handles network communication and connection testing.
    *   `@State private var isTestingConnection`: A boolean flag to indicate if a connection test is in progress.
    *   `@State private var testResult: String?`: Stores the result message of a connection test.
    *   `@State private var showingResetAlert`: Controls the visibility of the reset confirmation alert.

*   **Sections:**
    *   `targetSelectionSection`: Allows the user to choose between different `NetworkTargetType` options (e.g., Console, GUI).
    *   `consoleConfigurationSection`: Appears when the target is a console, providing input fields for **Console IP Address** and **Console Port**, and a button to **Test Console Connection**.
    *   `testingConfigurationSection`: Appears when the target is the GUI, providing input fields for **Mac GUI IP Address** and **GUI Port**, and a button to **Test GUI Connection**.
    *   `connectionStatusSection`: Displays the current **Connection Status** (disconnected, connecting, connected, error) and network availability, along with the **Last Successful Connection** time and any **Test Result**.
    *   `advancedSettingsSection`: Contains settings for **Connection Timeout** and a toggle for **Enable Network Logging**.
    *   `actionsSection`: Provides a button to **Reset to Defaults**, which triggers a confirmation alert.

*   **Actions:**
    *   `testConsoleConnection()`: Initiates a connection test to the configured console IP and port using `networkClient.testConnection()`.
    *   `testGUIConnection()`: Initiates a connection test to the configured GUI IP and port using `networkClient.testConnection()`.
    *   The "Done" button in the toolbar calls `networkSettings.saveSettings()` to persist any changes.
    *   The "Reset" button in the alert calls `networkSettings.resetToDefaults()` to revert settings.

### External Relationships

The **NetworkSettingsView** [NetworkSettingsView.swift](PRPs-agentic-eng/VoiceControlApp/NetworkSettingsView.swift) integrates with other system components primarily through its `@StateObject` dependencies:

*   **NetworkSettings (Data Model and Persistence):**
    *   The view observes changes in `NetworkSettings.shared` to display current configurations (e.g., `networkSettings.targetType`, `networkSettings.consoleIP`).
    *   It updates properties of `networkSettings` directly when user input changes (e.g., `networkSettings.consoleIP`, `networkSettings.timeoutSeconds`).
    *   It triggers `networkSettings.saveSettings()` when the "Done" button is tapped to persist changes to user defaults.
    *   It calls `networkSettings.resetToDefaults()` to revert settings.

*   **RCPNetworkClient (Network Operations):**
    *   The view utilizes `RCPNetworkClient.shared` to perform network connection tests (`networkClient.testConnection()`).
    *   It observes `networkClient.isNetworkAvailable` to display the overall network status.

This clear separation of concerns allows the view to focus solely on presentation and user interaction, while `NetworkSettings` handles data management and `RCPNetworkClient` manages network communication.

### Analysis Summary

# Network Settings Component Analysis

The **NetworkSettingsView** component is a SwiftUI view responsible for allowing users to configure and manage network settings related to the application's communication with external devices, specifically a Yamaha RCP console and a Mac GUI for testing. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting IP addresses and ports, testing connections, and viewing connection statuses.

## Core Responsibilities and Functionality

The primary responsibilities of the **NetworkSettingsView** are:

*   **Network Configuration Management**: Provides input fields for users to specify target IP addresses and ports for both the Yamaha console and a Mac GUI.
*   **Connection Testing**: Allows users to initiate connection tests to verify the reachability and responsiveness of the configured network targets.
*   **Status Display**: Presents real-time connection status and network availability information to the user.
*   **Settings Persistence**: Handles saving and loading of network settings to ensure configurations persist across app launches.
*   **User Interface**: Offers a clear and intuitive SwiftUI interface for all network-related configurations.

## Integration with Other System Components

The **NetworkSettingsView** integrates with other system components primarily through shared data models and network clients:

### 1. NetworkSettings (Data Model)

The view uses a `@StateObject` to observe and interact with a shared instance of the **NetworkSettings** class [NetworkSettingsView.swift](VoiceControlApp/NetworkSettingsView.swift:20). This class acts as the data model for all network-related configurations.

*   **Purpose**: Manages the actual network settings data, including IP addresses, ports, target types, connection status, and logging preferences. It also handles the persistence of these settings.
*   **Internal Parts**: Contains properties like `consoleIP`, `consolePort`, `testingIP`, `testingPort`, `targetType`, `connectionStatus`, `lastConnectionTime`, and `enableLogging`. It also includes methods for saving and loading settings (`saveSettings()`, `resetToDefaults()`).
*   **External Relationships**:
    *   **NetworkSettingsView**: Reads and writes network configuration values to and from the UI.
    *   **RCPNetworkClient**: Provides network parameters for connection tests and actual command sending.

### 2. RCPNetworkClient (Network Communication)

The view also uses a `@StateObject` to interact with a shared instance of the **RCPNetworkClient** class [NetworkSettingsView.swift](VoiceControlApp/NetworkSettingsView.swift:21). This client is responsible for handling the actual network communication.

*   **Purpose**: Manages the underlying network connections and sends/receives data to and from the configured network targets. It also provides functionality to test connections.
*   **Internal Parts**: Likely contains methods for sending RCP commands and testing network connectivity (`testConnection`). It also exposes a `isNetworkAvailable` property to indicate general network reachability.
*   **External Relationships**:
    *   **NetworkSettingsView**: Receives requests to test connections (`testConsoleConnection()`, `testGUIConnection()`) and provides the results back to the view for display. It also informs the view about general network availability.
    *   **NetworkSettings**: Uses the configuration data (IP, port) from **NetworkSettings** to establish connections.

### 3. SwiftUI Framework

The entire view is built using the SwiftUI framework, leveraging its declarative syntax for UI construction.

*   **Purpose**: Provides the visual structure and interactive elements of the network settings interface.
*   **Internal Parts**: Utilizes various SwiftUI views such as `NavigationView`, `Form`, `Section`, `TextField`, `Button`, `Toggle`, `ProgressView`, `Alert`, `HStack`, `VStack`, `Image`, and `Text`.
*   **External Relationships**: Relies on SwiftUI's state management (`@State`, `@StateObject`) to bind UI elements to the **NetworkSettings** and **RCPNetworkClient** data models.

## Key Functionality Breakdown

*   **Target Selection**: Users can select between different command destinations (e.g., console, GUI) using a `ForEach` loop iterating over `NetworkTargetType.allCases` [NetworkSettingsView.swift](VoiceControlApp/NetworkSettingsView.swift:50).
*   **Console Configuration**: This section allows input for `consoleIP` and `consolePort` [NetworkSettingsView.swift](VoiceControlApp/NetworkSettingsView.swift:90). A "Test Connection" button triggers `testConsoleConnection()` [NetworkSettingsView.swift](VoiceControlApp/NetworkSettingsView.swift:130), which uses **RCPNetworkClient** to perform the test.
*   **GUI Testing Configuration**: Similar to console configuration, this section allows input for `testingIP` and `testingPort` [NetworkSettingsView.swift](VoiceControlApp/NetworkSettingsView.swift:170). The `testGUIConnection()` function [NetworkSettingsView.swift](VoiceControlApp/NetworkSettingsView.swift:210) handles the connection test.
*   **Connection Status Display**: Shows the current `connectionStatus` from **NetworkSettings** and `isNetworkAvailable` from **RCPNetworkClient** [NetworkSettingsView.swift](VoiceControlApp/NetworkSettingsView.swift:250). It also displays the `lastConnectionTime` and any `testResult`.
*   **Advanced Settings**: Includes a slider for `timeoutSeconds` and a toggle for `enableLogging` [NetworkSettingsView.swift](VoiceControlApp/NetworkSettingsView.swift:320).
*   **Actions**: Provides a "Reset to Defaults" button that triggers an alert before calling `networkSettings.resetToDefaults()` [NetworkSettingsView.swift](VoiceControlApp/NetworkSettingsView.swift:370).
*   **Saving Settings**: The "Done" button in the navigation bar calls `networkSettings.saveSettings()` [NetworkSettingsView.swift](VoiceControlApp/NetworkSettingsView.swift:40) to persist the current configurations.

### Analysis Summary

# RCPNetworkClient Component Analysis

## Overview
The **RCPNetworkClient** is a core networking component within the VoiceControlApp, primarily responsible for handling communication related to Yamaha Remote Control Protocol (RCP) commands. It acts as the bridge between the application's UI and logic, and the external audio mixer device. It is implemented as an `ObservableObject` [VoiceControlApp/Shared/Services/RCPNetworkClient.swift:8], allowing SwiftUI views to react to changes in its network status and test results.

## Responsibilities
The primary responsibilities of the `RCPNetworkClient` include:
*   **Connection Management**: Establishing and managing network connections to the Yamaha audio mixer.
*   **Command Transmission**: Sending RCP commands to the connected mixer.
*   **Status Monitoring**: Providing real-time updates on network availability and connection status.
*   **Connection Testing**: Offering functionality to test the connectivity to a specified IP address and port.

## Architecture and Relationships
The `RCPNetworkClient` is designed as a singleton [VoiceControlApp/Shared/Services/RCPNetworkClient.swift:542] (`static let shared = RCPNetworkClient()`), ensuring a single point of control for network operations across the application.

It interacts with:
*   **NetworkSettings**: It relies on the `NetworkSettings` object [CLAUDE.md:606] for persistent storage and retrieval of network configuration parameters (e.g., IP address, port).
*   **SwiftUI Views**: Views like `NetworkSettingsView` [CLAUDE.md:551] observe the `RCPNetworkClient` to display connection status and enable/disable network-dependent UI elements.

## Implementation Details
The core implementation resides in [VoiceControlApp/Shared/Services/RCPNetworkClient.swift](VoiceControlApp/Shared/Services/RCPNetworkClient.swift).

### Key Properties
*   `@Published var isNetworkAvailable: Bool`: Indicates the current network reachability status.
*   `@Published var connectionStatus: String`: Provides a descriptive string of the connection state.
*   `@Published var lastConnectionTime: Date?`: Records the timestamp of the last successful connection.
*   `@Published var testResult: String?`: Stores the result of the last connection test.

### Key Functions
*   `init()`: Initializes the network client, likely setting up initial network monitoring.
*   `testConnection(ipAddress: String, port: Int)`: Initiates a connection test to the specified IP and port, updating `connectionStatus` and `testResult`.
*   `sendCommand(command: String)`: Sends a given RCP command string to the configured network destination.
*   `setupNetworkMonitor()`: Configures and starts monitoring network changes.

### Error Handling
The `RCPNetworkClient` incorporates error handling within its network operations, updating `connectionStatus` and `testResult` to reflect any failures during connection attempts or command transmission. Build logs indicate some asynchronous operation related errors that may need to be addressed [archive/build-logs/build_errors_final.log:765].
