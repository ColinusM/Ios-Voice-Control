    .package(url: "https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git", from: "10.0"),
    .package(url: "https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Inject.git", from: "1.0") // Hot reloading
]

// Secondary: CocoaPods (only for legacy dependencies)
// Migration timeline: 6-12 months to full SPM
```

## üöÄ Agentic Development Workflow

### Claude Code Integration Pattern

#### Context Priming Strategy
```markdown
1. Create project-specific CLAUDE.md with:
   - Swift/SwiftUI coding standards
   - Firebase integration patterns
   - Architecture guidelines (MVVM + Clean Architecture)
   - Testing requirements and patterns

2. Prime Claude Code before each session:
   - Read existing codebase
   - Review recent changes
   - Understand current feature context
```

#### Human-AI Collaboration Matrix
| Task Type | AI Responsibility | Human Responsibility |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Boilerplate Code** | 90% generation | 10% review/refinement |
| **SwiftUI Views** | 80% generation | 20% design/UX decisions |
| **Business Logic** | 60% generation | 40% validation/optimization |
| **Architecture** | 30% suggestions | 70% decision-making |
| **Complex Algorithms** | 20% assistance | 80% implementation |

### Development Workflow Pattern
```
1. Context Loading ‚Üí Prime Claude with project state
2. Planning ‚Üí AI-assisted feature breakdown
3. Implementation ‚Üí Claude generates code, human reviews
4. Validation ‚Üí Automated testing and manual verification
5. Iteration ‚Üí Continuous improvement based on feedback
```

## ‚ö° Hot Reloading and Rapid Iteration

### InjectionIII Setup (Game-Changer)
```swift
// Add to your App (2 lines for live programming)
#if DEBUG
@_exported import Inject
#endif

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // Your UI code here
        }
        .enableInjection() // Enable hot reload
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- **10+ hours/week saved** by eliminating rebuild cycles
- Modify running apps without losing navigation/data
- Sub-second change reflection
- Works on both simulator and iPhone X

### iPhone X Cable Development Optimization

#### Connection Strategy
```bash
1. Primary: Lightning cable connection
   - Fastest debugging speeds
   - Most reliable for intensive development
   - Required for initial device setup

2. Secondary: Wireless debugging
   - Enable after cable setup: Window > Devices and Simulators
   - Same Wi-Fi network requirement
   - Use for mobility during testing
```

#### iPhone X Specific Considerations
- **Memory Management**: 3GB RAM requires careful resource management
- **Thermal Awareness**: Monitor for overheating during extended debugging
- **Safe Area Testing**: Essential for notch compatibility
- **Face ID Testing**: Must test on device (simulator insufficient)

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Generation and Automation

### AI-Powered Code Generation Tools

#### 1. Claude Code (Primary AI Agent)
```bash
# Best practices for iOS development with Claude
- Focus on SwiftUI over UIKit for new development
- Request modern async/await patterns over completion handlers
- Specify iOS 16+ deployment target for feature compatibility
- Ask for comprehensive error handling and validation
```

#### 2. iOS-Specific Code Generation
```swift
// SwiftGen - Type-safe resource access
let image = Asset.Images.profilePicture.image
let color = ColorName.primaryBlue.color

// Sourcery - Boilerplate elimination
// Auto-generates: Equatable, Hashable, mock classes for testing

// Swift OpenAPI Generator - API client generation
// Generates type-safe networking from OpenAPI specs
```

#### 3. Template Systems
- **iOS Clean Architecture MVVM**: Complete project scaffolding
- **SwiftUI Design Systems**: Modern component libraries
- **Testing Templates**: Comprehensive test suite generation

### Validation Strategy for AI-Generated Code
```swift
// Always validate AI suggestions against:
1. Current iOS SDK features (avoid deprecated APIs)
2. Swift concurrency patterns (prefer async/await)
3. SwiftUI best practices (avoid UIKit mixing)
4. Performance implications (especially for iPhone X)
5. Security considerations (proper authentication flows)
```

## üß™ Testing and Quality Assurance

### Multi-Level Testing Strategy

#### Level 1: Syntax and Style
```bash
# SwiftLint - Code style enforcement
swiftlint --config .swiftlint.yml --strict

# Swift build validation
swift build --configuration debug

# Hot reload testing
# Verify InjectionIII functionality
```

#### Level 2: Unit Testing
```swift
// Swift Testing Framework (2025 standard)
import Testing

@Test("Firebase authentication flow")
func testFirebaseAuth() async throws {
    let authManager = AuthenticationManager()
    let result = try await authManager.signIn(email: "test@example.com", password: "password")
    #expect(result.isSuccess == true)
}
```

#### Level 3: Device Testing on iPhone X
```swift
// Performance testing specific to iPhone X constraints
func testMemoryUsageOnA11Bionic() {
    // Monitor memory usage under 3GB RAM constraints
    // Test thermal performance under sustained load
    // Validate Face ID integration
}
```

#### Level 4: UI and Integration Testing
```swift
// XCUITest for complete user flows
func testAuthenticationFlow() {
    let app = XCUIApplication()
    app.launch()
    
    // Test complete sign-in flow on actual device
    // Verify safe area handling with notch
    // Validate biometric authentication
}
```

### Performance Optimization for iPhone X

#### Memory Management
```swift
// Optimize for 3GB RAM limitation
- Implement lazy loading for heavy resources
- Use weak references to prevent retain cycles
- Monitor memory warnings and respond appropriately
- Implement efficient image caching strategies
```

#### Build Optimization
```bash
# Debug build settings for faster iteration
Build Active Architecture Only: Yes
Optimization Level: None (for debugging)
Debug Information Format: DWARF

# Release build settings for performance testing
Optimization Level: Optimize for Speed
Dead Code Stripping: Yes
Strip Debug Symbols: Yes
```

## üì± SwiftUI + Firebase Integration Best Practices

### Modern Authentication Pattern
```swift
@Observable
class AuthenticationManager {
    var authState: AuthState = .unauthenticated
    var currentUser: User?
    
    enum AuthState {
        case unauthenticated
        case authenticating  
        case authenticated
        case biometricRequired
    }
    
    func signIn(email: String, password: String) async throws {
        // Claude Code generates comprehensive auth flow
        // with proper error handling and state management
    }
}
```

### SwiftUI Architecture Pattern
```swift
// MVVM + Clean Architecture
struct AuthenticationView: View {
    @State private var authManager = AuthenticationManager()
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            switch authManager.authState {
            case .unauthenticated:
                SignInView()
            case .authenticated:
                MainAppView()
            case .authenticating:
                LoadingView()
            case .biometricRequired:
                BiometricAuthView()
            }
        }
        .environmentObject(authManager)
    }
}
```
