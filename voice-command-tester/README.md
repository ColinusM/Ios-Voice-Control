## üîß Troubleshooting & Debug Guide

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **"Send to Receiver" Button Issues**

**Problem**: "Successfully sent X RCP commands to receiver!" popup appears but no messages in ComputerReceiver GUI.

**Root Cause**: GUI receiver's UDP server not actually listening despite showing "Server started on port 8080".

**Solution Steps**:
1. **Check Mode Setting**: Ensure GUI receiver shows "Development (UDP 8080)" not just "Development"
2. **Verify UDP Server**: Test with: `netstat -an | grep 8080` - should show listening port
3. **Restart GUI Receiver**: Close and restart if mode was incorrect
4. **Test Direct UDP**: Use debug command to test receiver directly:
   ```python
   import socket, json
   sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
   test_msg = {"content": "test", "rcpCommands": [{"command": "test", "description": "test"}]}
   sock.sendto(json.dumps(test_msg).encode(), ('127.0.0.1', 8080))
   ```

#### **Server Communication Flow**

**Working End-to-End Flow**:
1. **Browser** (localhost:5001) ‚Üí Process command ‚Üí Generate RCP ‚Üí Click "Send to Receiver"
2. **Flask Server** ‚Üí Receives send request ‚Üí Creates UDP packet ‚Üí Sends to port 8080
3. **ComputerReceiver GUI** ‚Üí UDP server listening on 8080 ‚Üí Displays voice command + RCP commands

**Debug Commands**:
```bash
# Test voice command tester server
curl http://localhost:5001/test

# Test direct receiver communication
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/send_to_receiver -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"content":"test","rcpCommands":[{"command":"test","description":"test"}]}'

# Check if receiver is listening
lsof -i :8080  # Should show Python process
```

#### **Professional Audio Terminology**

**Recently Added**: Support for "track" and "bus" terminology
- ‚úÖ `"send track 1 to bus seven"` ‚Üí `set MIXER:Current/InCh/ToMix/On 0 6 1`
- ‚úÖ Word numbers (seven, eight, five) supported
- ‚úÖ Professional abbreviations (trk, tr) supported

**Server Restart Required**: When modifying routing.py, channels.py, effects.py, or terms.py, restart the voice command server:
```bash
pkill -f "python.*server" && python server.py
```

#### **GUI Receiver Stability**

**Crash Prevention**: GUI receiver now runs in separate Terminal process for stability
**Port Conflicts**: Uses port 5001 for voice tester (not 5000) to avoid macOS AirPlay conflicts
**Message Format**: Receiver expects JSON with `rcpCommands` array containing pre-generated RCP commands
