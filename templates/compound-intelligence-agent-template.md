# Universal Compound Intelligence Agent Architecture Template

**Version**: 1.0  
**Purpose**: Template for creating specialized agent hierarchies with compound learning capabilities  
**Based on**: Advanced thinking from ADVANCED.md research  

## Core Principle

Transform research from **"exploration every time"** to **"incremental expertise updates"** through specialized agent hierarchies that accumulate domain knowledge across sessions.

## Architecture Pattern

### Level 1: Domain Specialist Agents
```
.claude/agents/
├── {domain}-specialist.md              # Primary domain expert
├── {domain}-research-coordinator.md    # Research methodology expert  
├── {domain}-knowledge-accumulator.md   # Knowledge storage & retrieval
└── {domain}-learning-debugger.md       # Failure analysis & optimization
```

### Level 2: Nested Sub-Agent Structure
```
{domain}-specialist/
├── agent-config.md          # Main coordinator (200k context)
├── coordinator.md           # Research orchestration (200k context)  
├── knowledge-base.md        # Accumulated expertise (200k context)
└── learning-debugger.md     # Methodology optimization (200k context)
```
